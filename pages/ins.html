      <h1>Let's Play Go Fish!</h1>
      <a href="index.html">Back</a>
      <p> The aim of the game is to collect the most 'tricks' or 'sets'.</p>
      <p>To begin, press 'Start Game' and enter the number of players (including yoruself) that you want to play.</p>
      <br>
      <ul>
        <li>Each player starts with 7 cards (2/3 players) or 5 cards (4 or more players).</li>
        <li>Play runs clockwise, starting with the player to the dealer's left.</li>
        <li>During their turn, each player 'goes fishing' by selecting a value of a card in their hand and another player, in the game this is done by clicking a card and an opponent, then clicking 'Take Turn'. If the selected player has any cards of that value the 'fisher' has made a 'catch'. The selected player must give the 'fisher' all their cards of that value. If the selected player has no cards of that value, the selector has not made a 'catch' and must 'Go Fish!' and draws a new card from the deck.</li>
        <li>If, during their turn, a player ends up with all 4 cards then they have collected a full set. The player then must immediately declare this and play their set face up, in front of them.</li>
        <li>If during play a player ends up with no cards in their hand they must draw a card from the deck, rather than 'going fishing' for cards from other people.</li>
        <li>The winner is the player with the most sets at the end.</li>
        <li>Once all 13 sets have been completed, play ends.</li>
      </ul>
