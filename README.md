#Go Fish Web App#

A Go Fish app made with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

Rules:

- The aim of the game is to collect the most 'tricks' or 'sets'.
- Each player starts with 7 cards (2/3 players) or 5 cards (4 or more players).
- Play runs clockwise, starting with the player to the dealer's left.
- During their turn, each player '_goes fishing_' by selecting a value of a card in their hand and another player. If the selected player has any cards of that value the '_fisher_' has made a '_catch_'. The selected player must give the '_fisher_' all their cards of that value. If the selected player has no cards of that value, the selector has not made a '_catch_' and must '_Go Fish!_' and draws a new card from the deck.
- A player who has made a successful '_catch_' may attempt to '_fish_' for more cards. The '_fisher_' can select any player (including the one they just '_fished_' from) and any card value (including the one they just '_fished_' for). This continues until the player fails to '_catch_' anything, at which point play moves to the next player.
- If, during their turn, a player ends up with all 4 cards then they have collected a full set. The player then must immediately declare this and play their set face up, in front of them.
- If during play a player ends up with no cards in their hand they must draw a card from the deck, rather than '_going fishing_' for cards from other people.
- Once all 13 sets have been completed, play ends.
