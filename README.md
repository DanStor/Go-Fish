# Go Fish
---------

An emulator for the card game 'Go Fish'. Choose how many opponents you want to play against and see who is better!

*(Hint: you should be better, there is no AI)*

## Rules:

- Each player starts with 7 cards (2/3 players) or 5 cards (4 or more players).
- Play begins with you, then each of your opponents from left to right.
- During their turn, each player 'goes fishing' by selecting a value of a card in their hand and another player, in the game this is done by clicking a card and an opponent, then clicking 'Take Turn'. If the selected player has any cards of that value the 'fisher' has made a 'catch'. The selected player must give the 'fisher' all their cards of that value. If the selected player has no cards of that value, the selector has not made a 'catch' and must 'Go Fish!' and draws a new card from the deck.
- If, during their turn, a player ends up with all 4 cards then they have collected a full set. The player then must immediately declare this and play their set face up, in front of them.
- If during play a player ends up with no cards in their hand they must draw a card from the deck, rather than 'going fishing' for cards from other people.
- The winner is the player with the most sets at the end.
- Once all 13 sets have been completed, play ends.

## Future TODO List
- **Write a them tune**
- When there are a large number of players, the game can get stuck towards the end as the random generators fail to find the right card from the right person. Range needs to be narrowed.
